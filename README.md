# Appdogs-caveadventure
It's a flappybird game defined by how the player is bound to mouse movement instead of the usual "jumping"
The code will break if you simply copy-paste it as is so you should probably import images and set them to the actual "appdog" and "background" variables (the player sprite and backdrop)
